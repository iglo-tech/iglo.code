# T3 Connect setup

Deployment and client configuration for T3 Connect. The [architecture note](../internals/t3-connect.md)
explains the trust boundaries; the [relay README](../../infra/relay/README.md#deployment) owns relay
provisioning instructions.

## Public application configuration

T3 Connect is disabled in a fresh clone. To build against the production deployment, copy the
repository-root example:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

For another deployment, set these values in the repository-root `.env` or `.env.local`:

```dotenv
T3CODE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<publishable key>
T3CODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=<JWT template name>
T3CODE_CLERK_CLI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<public OAuth application client ID>
T3CODE_RELAY_URL=https://relay.example.com
```

Process variables take precedence over `.env.local`, then `.env`. Use these canonical names;
the build loader supplies framework-specific aliases. These values are public identifiers.
`CLERK_SECRET_KEY` belongs only in the relay's secrets, never in client configuration.

Client and bundled-server builds embed the public values, so set them before building.
EAS preview and production environments need the publishable key, JWT template name, and relay URL.
Bundled servers also accept runtime overrides for operator-managed deployments.

Copy `infra/relay/.env.example` to `infra/relay/.env` for relay deployment settings.
Deploy `prod` before personal stages because it owns the retained database that their branches
depend on. The stack's `PublishClientConfig` action writes the resulting relay URL back to the root `.env`.

## CLI OAuth application

In Clerk's OAuth applications settings:

1. Create a public OAuth application for the T3 CLI, using authorization-code exchange with PKCE.
2. Allow the redirect URI `http://127.0.0.1:34338/callback`.
3. Enable the `openid`, `profile`, `email`, and `offline_access` scopes.
4. Enable **Device authorization grant** on the application. Headless and SSH authorization use
   it, and Clerk only advertises the device endpoint once it is on. The feature is in beta and
   Clerk enables it per account on request.
5. Set `T3CODE_CLERK_CLI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` to the generated public client ID in local and release
   build environments.

## JWT template

Create a Clerk JWT template named `t3-relay` with claims:

```json
{ "aud": "t3-code-relay" }
```

Set `T3CODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=t3-relay` for clients and
`CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE=t3-code-relay` for the relay. The production relay deployment environment
also defines `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`. The audience stays the same across relay stages; the relay
URL selects the deployment.

## Restricting sign-ups

Use Clerk's allowlist for permitted email addresses or domains, or Restricted mode for invitation-only
sign-up. An enabled empty allowlist blocks all new sign-ups.

Sign-up restrictions do not revoke an existing account's access. Ban the account in Clerk when
its active sessions and future sign-ins must be disabled.
