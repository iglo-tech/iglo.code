# Development

## First checkout

The application runs on Bun 1.4.3 or newer on macOS arm64, Linux x64, and Linux
arm64. Development and packaging use the version pinned in `.bun-version`.
The retained Vite+/pnpm contributor toolchain uses Node 24 independently of the
application runtime. Install Bun and Vite+ (`vp`) before starting the server. Set up a coding agent
using the [provider guide](../user/install.md#providers).

Install `vp` on macOS or Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://vite.plus | bash
```

Clone the fork and start it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iglo-tech/iglo.code.git
cd iglo.code
vp i
vp run dev
```

Open the pairing URL printed by the dev runner. The bare origin does not authenticate
a new browser.

For pull requests in this fork, set GitHub CLI's default repository after adding an
`upstream` remote:

```sh
gh repo set-default origin
gh repo set-default --view
```

The default should be `iglo-tech/iglo.code`. Otherwise GitHub CLI prefers upstream,
and the app's PR action can fail with `head invalid` for a branch pushed only to the
fork. This setting is shared by linked worktrees; repeat it for a fresh clone.

## Choosing a dev process

Use `vp run dev` for server and web.
`dev:server` and `dev:web` start those processes separately.

Flags go directly after the task name, for example `vp run dev --home-dir /tmp/t3code-dev`.
Add `--browser` to open a browser automatically.

### State and ports

Linked worktrees default to their own `.t3/userdata`, even when `T3CODE_HOME` is set.
The main checkout defaults to `~/.t3/dev/userdata`. An explicit `--home-dir` wins in both cases.
Never run a development server against the live `~/.t3/userdata`.
See [test data](../../AGENTS.md#test-data) for copying a consistent database snapshot.

Read ports from the `[dev-runner]` output. Worktrees derive stable preferences from their paths,
but occupied ports can shift them. `T3CODE_PORT_OFFSET` or `T3CODE_DEV_INSTANCE` can select a
different preference when needed.

### Sharing and remote debugging

`vp run dev --share` publishes the web port over the machine's tailnet and prints a pairing URL
for that origin. Give the tester the complete URL, including its token. The dev runner removes
its mapping on exit.

Leave `VITE_HTTP_URL` and `VITE_WS_URL` unset. Vite proxies the backend through the browser's
origin so the same build works over localhost and remote connections.

Shared runs enable bundled dev to avoid a network round trip for each import level.
`T3CODE_BUNDLED_DEV=0` opts out when debugging bundler differences. Two reload traps matter
when changing this setup:

- The web entry must dynamically import the app so React refresh initializes before application
  chunks. Static imports can work on first load and fail after a route split.
- Bundled dev rebuilds Tailwind through watched files. Its ordinary Vite hot-update hook expects
  a server/module graph that Rolldown does not provide.
- The app and its routes are lazy chunks, built on first request. A plugin pre-bundles the
  startup chain when the server starts. Renaming or moving a startup route or the app entry
  silently drops it from that list.

The workarounds live in the [web entry](../../apps/web/src/bootstrap.ts),
[Tailwind plugin](../../apps/web/vite/tailwind.ts), and
[startup warmup](../../apps/web/vite/warmBundledDev.ts).

`vp run dev --share --built` skips the Vite dev server. It runs `vp build --watch` for the web
app, and the backend serves `apps/web/dist` on the same tailnet URL and pairing flow. Use it when
someone tests over a slow link or only needs to use the app: loads are production size, and the
first load does not wait for dev bundling. There is no HMR. After an edit, wait for the
`built in` line (about 6 s), then reload. Until the first build exists, the URL shows a page that
reloads by itself. The license manifest is not generated in this mode. `--built` requires
`--share` and the `dev` mode.

#### Reusable dev credential

Use this only on a hostname where you trust every service. Browsers send cookies to all ports
on that hostname. Any service you visit there can receive the reusable admin credential,
including services unrelated to T3 Code. If you run untrusted services on that hostname, keep
normal per-environment pairing instead.

To use one browser profile across web dev worktrees on the same hostname, generate one fixed
value once:

```sh
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Put that value in the main checkout's gitignored `.env`:

```dotenv
T3CODE_DEV_AUTH_TOKEN=<the value generated above>
```

The `t3.json` Setup Worktree action links that file to each worktree's `.env`. The dev runner reads repository env files at startup. `.env.local` and inherited process
environment values override `.env`, so no per-worktree export is needed after setup.

For a manual worktree or launcher without that link, export the same fixed value instead:

```sh
export T3CODE_DEV_AUTH_TOKEN="<the value generated above>"
```

Do not generate a new value at startup. Start or restart `vp run dev --share` after configuration,
then open its printed startup pairing URL once per browser profile on that hostname. Later web dev
servers on the same hostname accept the shared cookie across ports. The cookie expires after 30
days. Reload an old tab if its URL now serves a replacement environment.

The token and startup pairing URLs are reusable administrative secrets. Never put them in a
commit, pull request, or public output. Every server still seeds its own auth database record at
startup and keeps its own SQLite data, signing key, and revocation state. Non-dev servers ignore the value. See [environment authentication](../internals/environment-auth.md#reusable-dev-credential)
for the security model.

## Checks

`vp run check:changed` runs CI's fast checks for your branch's changes: format and lint of the
changed files, `knip:check` when code or a manifest changes, the generated GraphQL checks, typecheck
of the affected packages and their dependents, and the test files beside the changed files. It maps
files to packages with [ci-changes.cjs](../../.github/scripts/ci-changes.cjs), as CI does. It
compares against the merge base with `origin/main`, or with a ref you pass. CI still runs the full
test suites and the jobs the summary lists, so a local pass does not promise a green CI run.

While you iterate, run single checks:

```sh
vp test run <files>
vp lint <files>
vp run --filter <package> typecheck
```

In `apps/web`, a test that renders React or touches the DOM is named `*.browser.test.{ts,tsx}`
and runs in headless Chromium with the React Compiler on, like the app. Other `*.test.ts` files
run in Node. The fork's plugin and workflow tests in `apps/web/integration` still use jsdom and
`react-test-renderer`.

TypeScript workspaces typecheck with tsc-rs, which has Effect diagnostics built in.
Keep `typescript`, `@effect/tsgo`, and the `effect-tsgo patch` prepare step: editors
still use them for Effect quick fixes and refactors. Keep `@effect/tsgo` on the
effect-tsgo version that tsc-rs ports (see the tsc-rs README), or the two disagree
on rule names.
Marketing keeps `astro check` for Astro files.

CI runs one Linux x64 job on pull requests, pushes to `main`, and manual dispatches.
It checks formatting, lint, types, a small smoke-test set, and the web/server build.
New runs cancel older queued and running checks for the same source repository and branch.
Run focused tests for changed behavior locally; CI does not run the full suite.
See [ci.yml](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) for the current checks.

Run `bun scripts/smoke-cli-archive.ts --source` locally for the source transport/persistence
check, or pass `--archive <path> --expect-version <version>` for an archive.
Run `bun apps/server/scripts/web-client-regression.ts source` for the real development client,
or pass `archive <path> <version>` for the shipped client. These checks use disposable environments;
set `T3_WEB_REGRESSION_BROWSER` to the Chromium executable when testing the client.

### Unused code

`vp run knip:check` checks unused files and dependencies across the repo, then
unused runtime exports in `apps/server`, `apps/web`, and every internal package under
`packages/`. Run this audit locally when needed.
Exported types and Effect schemas are allowed without consumers. The schema preprocessor
recognizes schema types, including aliases and schema classes; functions that create or decode
schemas remain checked. Canonical Effect service construction APIs stay exported with an explicit
`@public` annotation, which Knip recognizes. Completely unused files remain checked too.
Named exports in web UI component modules are kept as complete component sets. Knip ignores
unused exports in `apps/web/src/components/ui/*.tsx`, while still reporting an entire unused file.
Use `vp run knip --workspace apps/web` to audit one workspace, including exports,
or `vp run knip:production --workspace apps/web` to find code kept alive only by tests.
The full export audit still has findings and is not a repo-wide CI gate. Extend the
export check's workspace selectors as more workspaces become clean. Review callers before
deleting code; production mode can also report development scripts and test fixtures.
Runtime-discovered entrypoints and dependency exceptions belong in [knip.jsonc](../../knip.jsonc).
